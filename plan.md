Project Setup:
1. Seting up a new Node.js project:
    - Initialization TypeScript configuration.
    - Installation necessary npm packages (express, mongoose, @types/node, @types/express, @types/mongoose, typescript, nodemon, etc.).
2. Express Setup:
    - Creation an Express app in TypeScript (app.ts).
    - Seting up basic server configuration.
3. MongoDB Integration:
    - Installation Mongoose.
    - Connection to MongoDB in TypeScript (mongoose.connect).
    - Definition TypeScript interfaces for MongoDB models (e.g., User, Message).
4. User Authentication:
    - Implementation user registration in TypeScript.
    - Implementation user login in TypeScript.
    - Usage sessions for authentication.
    - Implementation session security measures in TypeScript.
5. API Routes:
    - Creating TypeScript-based routes for different entities (e.g., messages, users).
    - Implement create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for each entity.
6. Middleware:
    - Creating TypeScript middleware functions for tasks like authentication.
7. Testing:
    - tests for backend functions using.
    - Test controllers, models, routes, and middleware.
8. Security:
    - Implementation TypeScript-based security measures (e.g., input validation, secure password handling).
    - Using HTTPS for secure communication.

    Documentation:
    Documenting the backend project structure and how to run the application.
    Providing API documentation for the backend.)

9 . Deployment:
    - Deployment the backend to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
    - Seting up environment variables for sensitive information.
     - Ensure proper security configurations for the production environment.


Frontend Development:
    1. HTML Templates:
        - Creating TypeScript classes or interfaces for HTML templates.
    2. Sass Seting up:
        - Install Sass with TypeScript.
        - Set up a file structure for styles.
    3. Express.js for Server-Side Rendering:
        - Configuring Express.js for server-side rendering using TypeScript.
    4. Styling with Sass:
        - Style the HTML templates using Sass and TypeScript.
    5. Client-Side Scripts:
        - Implementing TypeScript-based functionalities for interacting with backend APIs (e.g., sending and receiving messages).
         - Handling user interactions with TypeScript.
    6. Testing:
        -  tests for frontend components using.
        - Test client-side scripts and styles.
    7. Security:
        - Implementing TypeScript-based security measures on the frontend.

    Integration:
    1. Connection Frontend and Backend:
        - Ensure proper communication between the client and server.
        - Handle API calls from the frontend using TypeScript.
    2. End-to-End Testing:
        - end-to-end testing to ensure the complete flow of the application is functional.
